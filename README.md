## Notes

While building the app, one challenge I encountered was making sure dynamic filtering (like search and funded/unfunded filters) didn’t conflict with one another. Also, figuring out when to use each type of methodsuch as .reduce(), .filter(), .map(), etc., was pretty challenging. However, once I understood how .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() work together with DOM manipulation, everything came together smoothly.
